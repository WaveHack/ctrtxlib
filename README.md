# libctrtx - CTR Text Library

Library with console text helper functions for Nintendo 3DS homebrew development.

It's basically a collection of wrapper functions for a few [ANSI CSI codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#CSI_codes) that [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) can use with printf.
